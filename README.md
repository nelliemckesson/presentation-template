# Atlas presentation template

This is a template for a presentation in Atlas.  

## Getting the template into Atlas

In this pre-release version of Atlas, the first step in using the template is to get a fresh copy of it into your GitHub account.  To do this, you'll need to clone the repository to your local machine, like this:

```
$ git clone --shallow https://github.com/oreillymedia/presentation-template.git <your presentation name>
````

(Be sure to use the "--shallow" option so that you don't get the version history.)  Once you download the template, you should create a new project on GitHub, and then add a remote on your local machine to your new presentation.  For example:

```
$ git remote add github git@github.com:aliginedleft/scatteredtoscatterplot.git
$ git push gihub master
```

Once you've pushed the new repo up, you can open it in Atlas.
