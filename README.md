# Atlas presentation template

This is a template for a presentation in Atlas.  

## Getting the template into Atlas

The first step in using the template is to get a fresh copy of it into your GitHub account.  To do this, you'll need to clone the repository to your local machine, like this:

```
$ git clone --shallow https://github.com/oreillymedia/presentation-template.git <your presentation name>
````

(*NB*: Be sure to use the "--shallow" option so that you don't get the version history)
